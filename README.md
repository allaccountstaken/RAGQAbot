NLP/LLM Project Requirements
1. Project Requirements

For the capstone project you're required to pick ONE of the following areas to focus on:

    Fine Tuning an LLM
    Build RAG pipelines 

Fine-tuning LLMs and building RAG applications are the two most commonly adopted NLP/LLM use cases in the enterprise world. We hope you can build something that's relevant in the job market.
Fine-tuning Project Instruction

    Choose one of the LLMs
    Ideally you work with an open-source LLM
    You can work with OpenAI fine-tuning API
    Find or build your fine-tuning dataset
    Define your evaluation criteria
    Adopt parameter efficient fine-tuning methods
    Fine-tune the model for a given task and evaluate the output 

RAG Project Instruction

    Choose a vector database
    Find a dataset to build your knowledge base
    Embed the data and and index the data in the vector DB
    Build a simple UI using streamlit or gradio
    Examples
        Document search
        QA bot
